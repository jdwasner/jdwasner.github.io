## Overview

The Data Decision System (DDS) was a centralized analytics platform designed to put reliable, up-to-date manufacturing data directly into the hands of decision makers. The system provided a single location where engineering, quality, and operations teams could access consistent dashboards backed by the production datalake, reducing reliance on ad-hoc data requests and manual analysis.

This project focused on **building the analytical layer of DDS: defining KPIs, writing SQL queries, and designing dashboards** that supported daily and weekly operational decisions.

## Problem

Prior to DDS, manufacturing data was fragmented across multiple sources and accessed primarily through ad-hoc SQL queries or manual spreadsheet analysis. This led to several challenges:
- Engineers and managers relied heavily on data specialists to pull metrics  
- Different teams used inconsistent definitions for the same KPIs  
- Investigations were slow, reactive, and often duplicated across departments  
- Decision makers lacked timely visibility into production, quality, and equipment performance  

As production issues arose, teams spent more time *finding and validating data* than *analyzing and acting on it*.

## Solution

I designed and built a suite of SQL-backed dashboards within the DDS framework that served as a trusted, self-service analytics layer for multiple departments.

Key elements of the solution included:
- Writing optimized SQL queries to aggregate and transform raw datalake data into analysis-ready datasets  
- Defining and validating KPIs (e.g., throughput, yield, downtime, utilization) in collaboration with stakeholders  
- Designing dashboards that aligned metrics with operational workflows and decision cadence  
- Ensuring dashboards refreshed consistently and reflected a single source of truth  

The resulting system allowed users to move directly from high-level metrics to deeper investigation without needing custom queries or manual data preparation.

## Impact

- Enabled engineering, quality, and operations teams to self-serve critical metrics and investigations  
- Reduced ad-hoc data requests and investigation turnaround time from days to minutes  
- Supported multiple departments with a shared set of trusted dashboards and KPI definitions  
- Dashboards remain actively used 9+ months after initial deployment, demonstrating durability and adoption
